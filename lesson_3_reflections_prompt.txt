When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would always want to pull changes manually instead of having Git automatically stay up to date so that it only pulls when I want to update and perhaps merge what I'm working on with other's work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is similar to a clone of someone elses work but stays within Github. A clone is taken from Github and put onto a local machine or can be a clone of a repository on the same local machine. A branch is simply a different path from the master branch within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit of having the state of the last known state of the remoted stored locally is if you decide to merge the branches or the code so that you can have the most up to date code at all times tested and functional.

How would you collaberate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

The only other way to collaberate that I have been exposed to is a Wiki type of site and it is not conducive to code sharing. It would be difficult to track changes and bug fixes. This is a much better way of version control and version collaberation instead of posting the latest version, because it could have changed by the time someone sees the message on a wiki site.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You would want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master when you are making changes and than pushing it to GitHub so that you can collaberate with colleagues before they are merged with the master.  You want to make sure that whoever you are collaberating with approves or checks your work before they branch is merged with master.
