When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would always want to pull changes manually instead of having Git automatically stay up to date so that it only pulls when I want to update and perhaps merge what I'm working on with other's work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is similar to a clone of someone elses work but stays within Github. A clone is taken from Github and put onto a local machine or can be a clone of a repository on the same local machine. A branch is simply a different path from the master branch within a repository.
